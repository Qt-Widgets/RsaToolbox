# Should do the following:
# - Clean build byproducts?
# - Regenerate documentation
# - Process QtCreator
# - Copy everything into /build directory
# Should be left with _deploy folder with immaculate templates and instructions for install
# Could create a "developer" mode for myself, with links to RsaToolbox results
