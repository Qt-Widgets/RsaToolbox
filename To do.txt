This library needs focus.
It is: Instrument control
It also needs: Bus, Logging

But it also has:
- String manipulation (General.h)
- Keys
- General technical types (QRowVector, QMatrix2D, ...) [QTechnical]
- General technical functions (linearSpacing(..)...)
- RF technical functions (NetworkData, Touchstone...) [QRf]
- Technical widgets (i.e. FrequencyLineEdit) [QTechnicalWidgets, or separate out]
- Widgets (About, ErrorLabel, TimedProgressbar...) [Q]

Separate this out.

It also reimplements several things that Qt (and other libraries?) already implement:
- Way to import Boost technical types, libraries into Qt?
- Keys (QSettings)
- Wizard (QWizard)
- More? (logging?)
